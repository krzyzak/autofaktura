# Autofaktura

This small CLI application is used for automatical invoice generation.
It fetches timesheet from your time tracker application (currently it works with Harvest only), and then gives you ability to generate that invoice (currently only inFakt API is supported).
You can create VAT invoice, as well as draft, which you can modify later.
If you wish, thereâ€™s also way to automatically send such invoice to your contractor.
